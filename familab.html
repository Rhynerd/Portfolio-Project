                <p>For the first official project in my UX/UI Bootcamp, the class was broken into teams of four to create low-fidelity prototypes for our own apps. My group chose to create the basis for an app that would allow users to find and buy tickets to concerts, as well as help them prepare for the performance in the process.</p>
                <p>My role in the team was to assist in user research, develop the user’s event lists in the prototype, and assist in editing.</p>

                <h5>Our Problem:</h5>
                <p>People interested in live music have been relying on multiple apps and websites to try and find performances in their area. In spite of all these sources, they have issues finding shows, venue information, and local artists.</p>

                <p>We began our research by looking into the potential competitors, direct and indirect. We elected bandsintown and StubHub to be the direct competiton while Goldstar and Etix served as indirect competition. Each member of the team reviewed one of the four. I was assigned to analyze Etix. Below are examples what each of us found:</p>

                <p>Following the desires of Mia Jones and our teacher, we began to build out the basis of what our app would be. This started with a round of brainstorming that would be condensed into a feature chart:</p>

                <p>Once we had our features in mind and a steady idea of the user’s typical journey in the process our app is meant to simplify, we began the development of a mind map:</p>

            <div class="musicaText col-lg-10">
            <p>For our low-fidelity prototype, we decided on providing the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User onboarding</li>
                <li>The ability to sign up or log in</li>
                <li>Access to an events page for logged in users, containing a list of events the user is tracking and a list of recommended events</li>
                <li>A feed tab for artists and venues, with the ability to see one local venue in further detail</li>
                <li>The ability to view and purchase tickets for an upcoming concert</li>

            <div class="musicaText col-lg-10">
                <p>We split the pages and features between us. Initially, I was given the home page, the upcoming events page. and the artists feed page. Eventually the user given the venue feed page was tasked to handle both feed pages, and the home page became a collaborative effort.</p>

                <p>I began by blocking out areas, but quickly expanded out to creating components for the different events. The initial component for the main page events would not the used in the final version of the home page, but would be repurposed for the pages dedicated to ordering tickets.</p>

                <p>The third implementation of event cards was my final, with the fourth iteration only recieving a filter options button for future versions.

                <p>The 04 series of sketches were the final set for the prototype. Our group had chosen to implement a bottom navigation bar so that users could easily swap between major segments.

                <p>Our users found the app easy to navigate and the login process simple. Compliments were given to our final price breakdowns during the purchase process as well as the feed system.</p>
                <p>There were still issues found. One user had difficulties completing the third task, as pictured above. Another user had trouble with the fact that one of the fees was unlabelled. This second user also noticed an inconsistency between the two payment systems. Our team also found our own issues both in the payment by credit card system and multiple visual errors.</p>

                <p>As a group, we applied our feedback in a final round of iteration before our presentaiton. The payment pages were almost completely remade. A suggested items box was added to the feed pages, which was a suggestion made by the user who had issues completing the task related to these pages.</p>
                <p>We also went through and hunted down every error we had personally noticed and made sure they would not exist once time came to present our work.</p>
